I have experience with Azure cloud computing and deployment, as well as continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). For data visualization, I have used Plotly and Streamlit, and I have worked with databases including MongoDB and SQL, as well as time-series databases like InfluxDB. I have also worked with security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) technologies and the Yocto Project for building embedded Linux systems.
